                                <br>The Pi Committee will reserve a block of rooms in a hotel and organize a handful of events, shows, clubs, etc., to coordinate reunion activities. The Reunion will span a weekend, starting with a kickoff party (specific details soon!). Between these larger events, you’ll have many optional events/shows to attend alongside your classmates.

                                <b>How much will this cost?</b>
                                <br>While we haven’t solidified our budget or ticket prices yet, the price associated with Pi Reunion can be broken into a few categories. Your registration fee will cover the background expenses associated with running an event this large. You'll be responsible for the cost of your hotel room, although we will be negotiating a discount for our block. Each additional event/show/activity you elect to participate will have its own cost associated with it. Your committee is working hard to bring down costs of this event, so stay tuned!

                                <b>How do these hotels work?</b>
                                <br>The committee will negotiate with hotels along the Vegas strip to find the best rates possible. Attendees will be able to reserve rooms from within the negotiated block for the discounted rate. Multiple alumni and their non-MIT guests can elect to room together for a maximum capacity of four people; this will not be coordinated by the Pi Committee. Additionally, there will be larger suites that you can choose to upgrade to. You are not required to stay in the Pi Reunion hotel block, although our negotiated rates represent a significant discount and are contingent on booking a certain percentage of the block. Plus, our events are being planned around our hotel location!
